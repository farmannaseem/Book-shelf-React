# Book Search App

This project is a React application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and maintain a personal bookshelf in the browser using localStorage.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farmannaseem/Book-shelf-React.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:

  cd Book-shelf-React  
3.Install dependencies using npm:  
  
  npm install
Running the Application
After you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application locally using the following command:
npm start

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The page will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the code. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

Testing
To run tests, you can use the following command:
npm test

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Building for Production
If you want to build the application for production, you can use the following command:
npm run build

This command will build the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is now ready to be deployed!

Learn More
You can learn more about Create React App and React.js in the Create React App documentation and React documentation.

For more advanced configuration and troubleshooting, refer to the documentation sections mentioned in the Advanced Configuration and Troubleshooting links.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
